Hey Dan,
thanks so much for your insightful advice on Exercism. Nothing is unsolicited
because my curiosity is insatiable.

(I'm writing to you in this format because I currently only have access to
a phone, and the resizing stuff doesn't work on exercism so I CAN'T SEND
MY MESSAGE rghh.)

- It is my personal opinion, but I find satisfaction in these kinds of optimizations.
But is it at all an optimization, considering all the conversions from i8 to isize?

- Change of mind: no disagreement to advice nr. 2. Implementation shortly.

- I knew about the pattern matching on references, but I just found the asterisk
more pleasing... But I now see that with your method, dereferencing only happens
once instead of twice, so that too shall be implemented.

Thanks, again!
